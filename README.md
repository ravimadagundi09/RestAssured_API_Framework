🚀 Building a Scalable API Automation Framework with Rest Assured & Cucumber 🛠️

I recently worked on setting up a robust Rest Assured Cucumber Framework for API testing. Here are the essential components that made the framework both scalable and efficient:

Cucumber BDD: 📝 Seamlessly write test cases in Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then) to enhance readability and collaboration between technical and non-technical teams.

Rest Assured: 🔗 Easily automate REST API testing with full support for HTTP methods, JSON/XML parsing, and validations using Rest Assured's fluent interface.

Maven for Dependency Management: 📦 Organize project dependencies and enable a smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines.

JUnit for Test Execution: ✅ Execute and manage test cases while generating reports for better test coverage insights.

POJO Classes: 📊 Model the API request and response objects for cleaner and reusable code.

Test Data Builder Pattern: 🏗️ Implement dynamic data-driven testing by building test data in a modular fashion.

Utility Classes (Utils.java): 🛠️ Create reusable helper functions like API request initialization, logging, and custom assertion methods.

Cucumber HTML Reporting: Generating detailed HTML reports after test execution, providing insights into pass/fail rates, and execution statistics.

Global Properties (global.properties File): 🌐 Centralize environment-specific configurations (e.g., base URLs, credentials) to simplify test execution across multiple environments.

🌟 With this framework, we can:

Achieve high modularity and scalability.
Promote easy maintainability with a clear separation of concerns.
Ensure comprehensive API test coverage using data-driven testing and reusable components.
Looking forward to enhancing this framework and exploring more in API automation! 💡
